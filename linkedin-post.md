🎮 Excited to share my latest project: a fully playable **Skip-Bo** web game built with modern web technologies! 

This isn't just another card game clone – it's a complete, production-ready implementation featuring:
- 🤖 Smart AI opponents with realistic gameplay patterns
- 🌐 Real-time multiplayer support using WebRTC
- 🎨 Beautiful, responsive UI with smooth animations
- ⚡ Lightning-fast performance thanks to Vite + React
- 🧠 Robust game state management with Redux Toolkit

What makes this special? I've tackled complex challenges like:
- Implementing Skip-Bo's intricate ruleset (stockpiles, building piles, discard mechanics)
- Creating an AI that doesn't get stuck and plays strategically
- Building peer-to-peer multiplayer without server dependencies
- Crafting delightful micro-interactions and animations

The tech stack: React, Redux Toolkit, Framer Motion, TailwindCSS, and WebRTC. Every line of code focuses on clean architecture and exceptional user experience.

🚀 Try it live and let me know what you think! I'd love to hear your feedback on the gameplay, UI/UX, or any suggestions for improvement.
